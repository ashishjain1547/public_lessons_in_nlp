<pre># I first met Elon Musk in 2012. At the time, I was hoping to write a book about his life and work. When I asked him if he would be willing to collaborate with me on the project, he declined, saying, "I don't want to do it." Despite this initial setback, my admiration for Musk's work only grew over the years.

Fast forward to a visit to Musk's SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California. As Musk and I made our way around the design studio's main floor, I was taken aback by the scale of the operation. We talked as Musk inspected prototype parts and vehicles.

# In our series of letters from African-American journalists, novelist, and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates reflects on his time in San Francisco during the dotcom boom and bust.

# In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Silicon Valley created some of the biggest technology companies the world had ever seen.

# In the late 1990s, Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, moved his company from Silicon Valley to Hawthorne, California.

# Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and the Boring Company, wants to send humans to Mars.

# There are many things that make Elon Musk stand out, but two of the most prominent are:

Entrepreneurial Success: Elon Musk is known for his remarkable entrepreneurial success in a range of industries, including technology, space exploration, and transportation. He co-founded PayPal, which revolutionized online payment systems, and went on to found companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, each of which is disrupting its respective industry in innovative ways.

Futuristic Vision: Musk is also known for his futuristic vision and ambition to push the boundaries of what is possible. He has made bold statements about his plans to colonize Mars, revolutionize transportation with Hyperloop technology, and merge humans with artificial intelligence. His vision and ambition have made him a highly influential figure in the tech industry and beyond.

# When Elon Musk was growing up in South Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, the world was a very different place.

# When Joshua Haldeman and his wife, Wyn, moved from Toronto to Cape Town, South Africa, in the early 1950s, the Haldemans had everything they needed: a house, a dance practice, a plane, and five children.

# Maye Musk was the nerd in her family.

# Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla Motors, is a master of the mind.

# Maye Musk is the mother of entrepreneur and tech billionaire Elon Musk. She has been married three times and has three children from her second marriage to Errol Musk. Elon Musk has one brother, Kimbal, and one sister, Tosca. Maye Musk is also a successful model and dietician.

# In the summer of 1988, Elon Musk did spend time in Minnesota, but he did not live with his mother's uncle. According to Musk's biography, "Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future," he spent about a year living with his father, Errol Musk, in South Africa before his mother Maye sent him to live with relatives in Canada. Musk then traveled to the United States and spent a summer in Minnesota, where he worked odd jobs and lived with a family friend. This experience gave him a taste of independence and allowed him to explore his interests in computers and technology.

# When Peter Nicholson met Elon Musk and Maye Kimbal at Queen’s University in Toronto, they were both working at the same bank.

# Elon Musk did attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a short time, but he was not known as the "serial entrepreneur" during his time there. Musk attended MIT for a few months in the late 1980s before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania to study business and physics.

Musk did have an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age, and he started his first company, a video game software company called Zip2, while he was still a student at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the term "serial entrepreneur" is typically used to describe someone who has started multiple companies over the course of their career. While Musk has certainly gone on to found and co-found several successful companies, he was not yet known for this during his time at MIT.

While at Stanford, Musk pursued a Ph.D. in energy physics, but he ultimately left the program after just two days to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions in the emerging field of the internet. He co-founded Zip2, a web software company that provided online business directories and maps to newspapers, and later went on to co-found other successful companies like PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX.

# Kimbal Musk, one of Elon Musk’s brothers and the co-founder of Zip2, told me that he and his brother had a strained relationship.

# In the early days of Zip2, the car-sharing company founded by Elon Musk, the young engineers at the company were given little time to think.

# In 1996, Zip2 launched a free online classified advertising service for newspapers.

# Kimbal Musk, one of the co-founders of Zip2, a car-sharing service that was sold to Google for $1bn in 2004, told the BBC’s Stephen Sackur in an interview that when he sold the company to Google, he had no idea what he was doing.

# When Elon Musk started X.com, a Silicon Valley-based online bank, he enlisted the help of Peter Fricker, Craig Payne, and Peter Ho.

# When I first met Elon Musk at his start-up called X.com in the early 1990s, he was working on a payment system for Palm Pilot handhelds, so I asked him what he was up to and he said he was working on a payment system for Palm Pilot handhelds.

# When Elon Musk bought X.com in 1999 for $1bn (£640m), he inherited a start-up that had become embroiled in a bitter dispute with two of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Peter Thiel and Peter Levchin.

# In January 2002, PayPal co-founder Elon Musk met with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and PayPal’s other co-founder, Scott Moritz, to discuss the future of the company.

# Elon Musk, as of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, was still alive and actively involved in his various ventures, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.

While it is true that Musk co-founded Zip2 and PayPal, he did not die at the age of 45. In fact, he was born on June 28, 1971, which would make him 51 years old as of March 2023. It's important to fact-check information before sharing it to ensure that we're not spreading false information.

# Three years ago, Elon Musk was in the midst of one of the most turbulent periods of his career.

# In the summer of 2001 Elon Musk and his wife Justine were living in Palo Alto, California, running their start-up X.com.

# When the Mars Society, a group of scientists working on sending humans to Mars in the 2030s, held its annual dinner in Los Angeles last year, the invitations were sent out.

# Alexander Zubrin is not a known Russian entrepreneur, and there is no record of him expressing interest in buying Elon Musk's private rocket company, SpaceX.

Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of making space travel more affordable and accessible. The company has since become a major player in the aerospace industry and has successfully launched a number of rockets and spacecraft, including the Falcon 9 rocket and the Crew Dragon spacecraft.

It is not uncommon for entrepreneurs and investors to express interest in acquiring companies, but there is no known instance of anyone attempting to buy SpaceX from Elon Musk.

# According to Elon Musk's biography, "Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future," when SpaceX needed to connect its buildings to the internet, Musk asked his employees to do it over a weekend in the middle of the night. The task involved laying fiber-optic cables across the SpaceX campus to connect the company's various buildings to the internet.

Musk believed that outsourcing the task would be too expensive and time-consuming, so he asked his employees to do it themselves. Over the course of a weekend, the SpaceX team worked tirelessly to lay the cables, often working through the night to get the job done. The effort paid off, as SpaceX was able to connect its buildings to the internet at a fraction of the cost it would have taken to outsource the work.
